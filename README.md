AngularJS app for CoBiG²'s new website
======================================
Right now, this is more of a proof of concept, but hopefully it will soon replace [CoBiG²'s old website](http://cobig2.fc.ul.pt).

Demo at: [staging.cobig2.com](http://staging.cobig2.com/?unlock=true)

Technologies
============
* Node.js / Express — Backend API
* Redis — tokens storage
* AngularJS — Frontend app
* Twitter Bootstrap — Responsive layout

APIs used
=========
Probably don't need all of them, but I'm just playing to learn and see what works best.

* LinkedIn — members profiles
* Mendeley — list of papers published
* Facebook — photos
* GitHub — static content, stored in markdown on a repo and rendered client side (for now)

Environment variables
=====================
See the file vars.fish for a list of env vars that must be set.
